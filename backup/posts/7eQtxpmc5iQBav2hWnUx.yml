  ▶ WHAT MAKES LEVEL UP UNIQUE ◀

  ▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔

  🔝CONCEPT WORKSHOPS🔝

  Immerse yourself in the right culture of learning with our concept workshops. We believe you will benefit more from a well structured class focused on a specific topic rather than the typical combination class that you get in your local dance school.


  🔝THEME NIGHTS🔝

  As much as we focus on the learning environment we love to party! Have the best time with our theme nights and dance the night away with the best music from the best bachata djs in Australia! And get ready for some surprises 🤭


  🔝VENUE🔝

  We have a BRAND NEW VENUE, in the southside of Brisbane! It's next to the hub of the Southside Chinatown, next to hotels, a Westfield shopping centre, lots of places to eat and rest! The ultimate dancaholics dream. Exciting things are coming our way!

  BTP Conference Centre

  1 Clunies Ross Court, Eight Mile Plains QLD 4113


  🔝FREESTYLE BACHATA COMPETITION🔝

  ▶ WHAT WE ARE ABOUT ◀

  ▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔

  LEVELING UP - the festival that improves your dancing by having a structure and focus of technique elements that identify what is missing in your dance and how to work on that.


  LAUGH UNTIL YOU CRY - we want you to party hard, meet with friends and new dancers, enjoy every moment and dance your hearts out till we are sure that you will have post - festival depression!


  UNITE & GROW - This is a festival where you grow in the festival, not just leading up to a festival. Where you unite to learn, to grow and just have the most wonderful experience alongside those who are just as passionate as you. It's all about you!
