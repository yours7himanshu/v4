  ⭐⭐⭐ BBF24 ⭐⭐⭐


  The highlight of our season 2023/2024 is the Berlin Bachata Festival 2024 - BBF24.


  📅 June 21-23 2024


  📌 ATELIER GARDENS


  WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE?


  ⭐ Workshops that push the boundaries of creativity and norms - we are proud to be the first event that introduced concepts like Role Rotation and genderless Styling to Berlin. Many more to follow


  ⭐ ADICTO intimacy - no need to rush to the front line to get a good spot in the workshops, at ADICTO, you are in direct contact with the artists - they are human, not celebrities


  ⭐ Unique Fusion Line-up - considered one of the best Bachata Fusion line-ups, we select artists representing a range of styles and concepts. We carry the scene forward by supporting modern and diverse ideas, rather than just copying whatever is successful


  ⭐ BERLIN - we represent the capital of Berlin and its Bachata scene - diverse, multicultural, edgy, and exciting. It is the place to be this summer
